# ADM-HW1

Apart from this, my repository contains two files: 

* **stamps.pdf**: I merged together in a unique *.pdf*  file all the screenshots of my submissions. 

  *Note*: I submitted the exercise *# Exercise 74 - Xml - XML 2 - Find the Maximum Depth* one more time after taking the first screenshot, getting a better result. So I put this new result in the last page of *stamps.pdf* and add some text comments about this in the file as well. 

* **scripts.py**: this is the *.py* file containing the scripts of all the exercises, organized according to the structure you indicated.
